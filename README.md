React SmartForm
===============

This project aims to make it easy to produce highly dynamic forms in React. "Smart" forms may be defined in a simple, declarative configuration format, which will be run through various "builders" in order to build up the final form.

Development
-----------

This project is a monorepo.  To get started on development, you can run `yarn install` from the repository root. This will install dependencies for all of the packages.
